/**
 * Defines the interface for classes that know to supply class data for a class name.
 * The idea is to have the possibility to retrieve the data for a class from different sources:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Class path - the class is already loaded by the class loader</li>
 * <li>String - the string (the source code) is compiled dynamically via {@link javax.tools.JavaCompiler}</>
 * <li>Generate the source code programmatically using something like {@code https://github.com/square/javapoet}</li>
 * </ul>
