I'm pleased to announce the release of PF4J 0.10.0. Thanks to everyone for their hard work! A special thanks to MÃ¡rio Franco ([@lightglitch](https://github.com/lightglitch)).

Enhancements
------------

* Improve logging for `DefaultExtensionFinder`
* [#22](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): defense against not find META-INF/extensions.idx
* Specify that `PluginClassLoader` is a Parent Last ClassLoader; it loads the classes from the plugin's jars before delegating to the parent class loader
* [#33](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): demo build configuration with gradle
* [#39](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): fix build on JDK 1.8
* [#40](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): add `PluginStatusProvider` (plugin status - enable/disable)
* [#41](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): add plugin archive source abstraction (add `PluginRepository`)
* Integration with Travis CI
* [#42](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): stop plugin issue
* [#44](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): replace Version class with [semver lib](https://github.com/zafarkhaja/jsemver) (the idea is to support plugins dependency version validation)
* Make plugins directory canonical (make log more readable)
* [#53](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): thread safety in `PluginClassLoader`
* [#63](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues/22): extended pf4j to allow custom plugin class loaders
