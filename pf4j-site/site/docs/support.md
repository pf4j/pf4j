If you need help, you have a question, or you need further details on how to use
PF4J, you can refer to the following resources:

 - This [documentation web site](https://decebals.github.io/pf4j/)
 - The [PF4J mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/pf4j)
 - The [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/wiki), that is
   accessible and modifiable by all GitHub users.
 - The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues) where you can
   post bug reports, request for features, questions, etc.

I suggest you to avoid writing to the project maintainer email address directly,
since your email may be of interest for other users. So if you prefer email
communication the mailing list is possible the best place where to ask, since
other users and developers can read your questions and answer and benefit from
them.
